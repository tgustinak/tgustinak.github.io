      <h1 id=tomáš-gustiňák>Tomáš Gustiňák</h1><p>Hi! I am 37 years old passionate and reliable web engineer currently seeking new challenges
to utilize my expertise and help you exceed your goals.<p>Past couple years I have spent most of my time working on frontend projects. Even when I was working as a full-stack engineer,
there was always more work on frontend than the backend. I worked primarily with React (however I started with Vue and built a product with it) and TypeScript.<p>My early career was shaped by backend engineering. VPS provisioning, building APIs, database modeling, manual deployments and running migrations,
working with third-party services. Therefore I have been leaning more towards backend development recently (back to the roots) and started
a personal projects in Golang + HTMX + PostgreSQL. I would like to learn more about app containerization, k8s, infrastructure and DevOps, because
this world has changed a lot so I am tinkering with it a bit and planning to provision VPS and maintain it to get more familiar with it.<h2 id=skills>Skills</h2><h3 id=tech-skills-5-years>Tech Skills (5+ years)</h3><ul><li>JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Vue, Redux, Webpack, Vite, Module Federation, &mldr;)<li>NodeJS (Express)<li>HTML/CSS<li>MySQL<li>PostgreSQL<li>PHP (Zend, Laravel)</ul><h3 id=tech-skills-5-years-1>Tech Skills ( years)</h3><ul><li>Ruby<li>Vuejs<li>GraphQL<li>Golang</ul><h3 id=soft-skills>Soft Skills</h3><ul><li>Goal-oriented<li>Reliable<li>Flexible<li>Communicative<li>Determined<li>Detail-oriented<li>Creative<li>Honest<li>Loyal</ul><h2 id=work-experience>Work Experience</h2><h3 id=since-2024-indra-avitech>Since 2024 Indra Avitech</h3><p>Role: Frontend Engineer<ul><li>Part of a team responsible for development of common library for other teams, owning couple SPAs:
