# Tomáš Gustiňák

Hi! I am 37 years old passionate and reliable web engineer currently seeking new challenges
to utilize my expertise and help you exceed your goals.

Past couple years I have spent most of my time working on frontend projects. Even when I was working as a full-stack engineer,
there was always more work on frontend than the backend. I worked primarily with React (however I started with Vue and built a product with it) and TypeScript.

My early career was shaped by backend engineering. VPS provisioning, building APIs, database modeling, manual deployments and running migrations,
working with third-party services. Therefore I have been leaning more towards backend development recently (back to the roots) and started
a personal projects in Golang + HTMX + PostgreSQL. I would like to learn more about app containerization, k8s, infrastructure and DevOps, because
this world has changed a lot so I am tinkering with it a bit and planning to provision VPS and maintain it to get more familiar with it.
