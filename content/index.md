# Tomáš Gustiňák

Hi! I am 37 years old passionate and reliable web engineer currently seeking new challenges
to utilize my expertise and help you exceed your goals. I am willing to learn what I don't know yet
and teach what I already know. I value **professionalism**, **trust and respect**, **friendly attitude** and **work-life balance**.
I always assume best intentions when talking to someone and if I can help, I will help.

I started as a full-stack engineer in a small Marketing Agency - **SEDUCO**, working on small marketing websites to help friends of mine start their business.
This work has got me into the web development world.

Later on I had an opportunity to work in **TRIONYX Technologies** and I transitioned into backend engineer working on a nation-wide news portal
with tens of thousands concurrent users during prime time. We used technologies like Memcached, Varnish for caching, load balacing, database replicas, etc.
The management decided to make their own CMS so we developed our first SPA CMS
using Vue and Laravel and I slowly moved towards a fullstack role because the complexity of the frontend apps grew a lot compared to the
old-style html+css templates. In TRIONYX I introduced code reviews, migrated from svn to git, we updated our tech stack
to boost productivity of the team (gulp, SASS, Zend -> Laravel, Vagrant) and there was a lot more on the table (CI/CD, better test coverage, Dockerizing apps, ...),
unfortunatelly there was very little understanding from the management for such big changes that it was on hold for a long time.
I decided to move on with my career somewhere where I can personally and professionaly grow more. We stayed in touch to these days
with the old management and we have good relationship.

I land my first fully remote job at **Sticker Mule** (US). This was the first time I worked in fully remote team with global coverage.
It was a huge boost to my experience, everyone was a true professional yet very friendly and kind people. Exceptional company culture,
new tech stack (React, Ruby, k8s, Docker, ...). I was part of a team responsible for internal applications supporting manufacturing
and shipping of our products (printer monitoring, buying shipping and printing shipping labels, live reports using websockets, ...).
Unfortunately, when Covid hit a lot of us were laid off due to unstability of the market.

My next work experience was working for a **Whereby**. Norwegian startup focused on building video conferencing app. Again a fully remote team (mostly EU),
amazing culture. From start I was part of a team responsible for smoothing up signup process and onboarding of the user. We tested different UIs
using feature flags, brainstorming and we did user testing and developers get direct feedback from testers so we can iterate on our ideas with POs.
Later on I switched teams to work on the billing side of our product. I was responsible for simplifying of billing business clients because we had
different plans for each business customer as sales team was trying out different approaches. So we were looking for a way how to simplify and automate it.
I was part of the on-call with 1 week rotation period. At this point I felt a bit burnt out and lost interest in software engineering. I had a 2 years
old daughter and a lot has changed in past years so I decided to take 1 year off to regenerate and spend time with my family.

My current job is working for **Indra Avitech** as a Frontend Engineer on a huge international project for Aviation industry. I am part of a team
responsible for developing common library, set of utilities and UI components for other teams. We own couple apps as well (User and Organization Management,
Certificate Management, Legal Recordings, Notification Management). We develop web components for other teams to integrate into their UIs. It's a micro-frontend architecture
using module federation which brings a lot of challenges with version management.
Unfortunately the situation in the company is not very good, people are leaving, uncertain future because our parent company (Indra) is coming through
a lot of changes switching focus to military hardware, our management resigned, ...

I decided to start looking for another job where I can grow and use my experience to build something meaningfull with impact. Hopefully we can meet and
get to know each other better. Looking forward to hearing from you :)
